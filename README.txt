In this assigment we had to make a code that would do certain functions based on the inputs -r, -f, -e, -s. We were asked to use recusive functions in our code when using the -r input. My code has a total of 7 functions that handle each case that is mentioned in the assignment. 
3 of the functions that I created are recursive 3 are regular function and 1 is the main function that I used to format my code.
